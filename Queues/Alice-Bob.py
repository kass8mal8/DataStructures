"""
    Alice has two queues, Q and R, which can store integers. Bob gives Alice
    50 odd integers and 50 even integers and insists that she store all 100
    integers in Q and R. They then play a game where Bob picks Q or R
    at random and then applies the round-robin scheduler, described in the
    chapter, to the chosen queue a random number of times. If the last number
    to be processed at the end of this game was odd, Bob wins. Otherwise,
    Alice wins. How can Alice allocate integers to queues to optimize her
    chances of winning? What is her chance of winning?
